Ongoing, incremental backups of warm data
Backup of all data - for example, before upgrading the indexer

To back up hot buckets as well, you need to take a snapshot of the files, using a tool like VSS (on Windows/NTFS), ZFS
snapshots (on ZFS)

If no tools:
manually roll a hot bucket to warm and then back it up

splunk _internal call /data/indexes/<index_name>/roll-hot-buckets ?auth <admin_username>:<admin_password>

It is ordinarily not advisable to roll hot buckets manually, as each forced roll permanently decreases search
performance over the data. As a general rule, larger buckets are more efficient to search. By prematurely rolling buckets,
you're producing smaller, less efficient buckets.

In Indexer cluster:
create a script that goes through each
peer's index storage and uses the bucket ID value contained in the bucket name to identify exactly one copy of each
bucket. The bucket ID is the same for all copies of a bucket.
