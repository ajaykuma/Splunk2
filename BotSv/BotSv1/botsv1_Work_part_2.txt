Viewing stream:http Events continued..

Look under interesting fields:
c_ip(client ips) shows 3 values contained in various events.
click on c_ip, which shows 3 values in 100% events
click on 1st entry and that gets added to the search

Query: index=botsv1 sourcetype="stream:http" c_ip="40.80.148.42"
<search>
Shows 18 events (depends on sampling)

Viewing HTTP events for iamreallynotbatman.com(fake webserver)

Query: index=botsv1 sourcetype="stream:http" imreallynotbatman.com
Note** here we don't use traditional way ie name=value and just search for occurence.
shows 5003 events without sampling.
shows 217 events with 1:100 sampling.

Looking at one of the event shows
cookie: ae72c62a4936b238523950a4f26f67d0=v7ikb3m59romokqmbiet3vphv3
dest_content: areas%5b%5d=content&ordering=popular&searchphrase=any&searchword=the&task=<----shows document moved
and so on..

Let's look for some attack
--say obvious attack URLs,such as directory traversal path containing ../../../../ ( an old directory traversal way in 90s)
--header fields that reference a Web Vulnerability Scanner
Now Vulnerability scanner tries every attack in world

If sampling was turned on, turn it off
shows 22,200 events

Scroll down and search for 

BOTSv1.1.1: Scanner Name:Find the brand name of the vulnerability scanner .

BOTSv1.1.2: Find Attacker IP

BOTSv1.1.3: Find the IP address of the web server serving: imreallynotbatman.com

Accept: */*

Note** Here we see a commercial vurnerability scanner used to scan the website to find some attacks.
Looking at source ip ie c_ip we would know the ip address of attacker.

IP of attacker : 40.80.148.42 (i.e. c_ip)
Scanner name: Acunetix
dest_ip: 192.168.250.70

BOTSv1.1.4 : Defacement Filename
Find the name of the file used to deface the web server serving "imreallynotbatman.com"
Hints:
It was downloaded by the webserver ,so the server's IP is a client address,not a destination address.
Remove the filter to see all such 9 events, Examine the URI values.

Note** Servers should be only servers and never be clients.
Thus nobody should be opening up a browser on webserver ,visting a site and downloading a file.
Reasons being:--dangerous and unsanitary (cause file might have a virus)
              --Somebody can take over the server, thus then can run malware on server .
Thus we should have firewall rules that prohibit server to intiate any connection.
Server shouldnt send any packet anywhere (unless authorized), thus should only respond to packets.

Thus we need to find traffic that comes backwards,if there is connection coming from webserver through some other host , that's bad.

dest_ip: 192.168.250.70 is the webserver in our case.

Thus going back to query:(with sampling 1:1000)

Query: index=botsv1 sourcetype="stream:http" 
--shows all traffic on our network

c_ip:3
Let's look at c_ip (client ip) and check if webserverip (dest_ip) shows as one of c_ip.

If not, let's reduce sampling to 1:10
c_ip:5
Let's look at c_ip (client ip) and check if webserverip (dest_ip) shows as one of c_ip, which confirms
there were requests coming from webserver.
(which shouldn't have happened)

add c_ip to query to see all events where traffic went backwards:
Query: index=botsv1 sourcetype="stream:http" c_ip="192.168.250.70"

Shows 9 events (without sampling turned on)

#looking at defacement file
Query: index=botsv1 sourcetype="stream:http" c_ip="192.168.250.70"
Look for : src_headers: GET /poisonivy-is-coming-for-you-batman.jpeg HTTP/1.0
Host: prankglassinebracket.jumpingcrab.com:1337

BOTSv1.2.1: Staging Server IP
(Search the HTTP GET events containing the FQDN)
Look again in event which showed defacement file and search for  dest_ip
 dest_ip: 23.22.63.114 (probably criminal' staging server i.e a victim's server)

BOTSv1.2.2: Leetspeak Domain
Use a search engine outside Splunk, find other domains on same staging server.
For example: search 23.22.63.114 in google
https://ipinfo.io/23.22.63.114
https://www.threatcrowd.org/ip.php?ip=23.22.63.114 etc..

Which confirms it is being used by various malicious attacks.
