Splunk Indexed
This is recommended way to explore and analyze the BOTS dataset.

Original data was generated 6 years ago by splunk administrators.
Then they used it for live CTF for a year , then it was open-sourced.

Download the dataset from this location: botsv1_data_set.tgz (6.1GB compressed)

Alternatively, this collection represents a much smaller version of the original dataset containing only attack data. 
In other words, "just the needles, no haystack." botsv1-attack-only.tgz(135MB compressed)

We can upload this data to our splunk by either adding it as app 
Apps>settings icon>Install app from file >choose file > botsv1_data_set.tgz or botsv1-attack-only.tgz

Another option is to unzip and untar and copy the folder botsv1_data_set or botsv1-attack-only into 
SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps i.e. in windows:C:\Program Files\Splunk\etc\apps

--restart splunk

After uploading 'botsv1_data_set' app or 'botsv1-attack-only' app look under 'What to Search' which shows the 
number of events.
Note** I uploaded 'botsv1-attack-only' .

Clicking on data summary shows:
Host and count (here count matches the number of events)
number of events = xxxxxx

Additionally click on options:
Hosts(1)---ipaddresses/names etc
Sources(15)--show more meaningful information
For example: '/var/log/suricata/eve.json' for suricata which is opensource intrusion detection system.
It shows about attacks, here events are such as 'Trojan detected','dos attack detected'.
For example: 'C:\inetpub\logs\LogFiles\W3SVC1\u_ex160810.log'--webserver log and inetpub means windows based web server
For example: 'WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational'--Microsoft sysmon
For example: 'WinEventLog:Application'
For example: 'WinEventLog:Security'
For example: 'WinEventLog:System'
SourceTypes(5)--shows different source types

Querying:
All data we would want to look into is in index="botsv1"

#find sourcetypes
Query:
| metadata type=sourcetypes index=botsv1

Search and reporting > search > index = "botsv1" (If time selected 'Last 24 hours')-- No results found.
Note** we can choose all time ,which will show us all the data, but data might be huge,so first

if 'index="botsv1"' selected , shows total 955,807 events.

Let's turn on the 'Event Sampling'
Sampling: 1:1000 (i.e. show every 1000th event)
Now select 'All Time'

>search

Look at count of Events in comparision to earlier known total number of events.
It may show: 941 events
Note** Remember its a random sampling of events, which means if we search again we would get different events.

Looking at results might show different Hosts
such as 'host= ubuntu----'
        'xml data for microsoft windows sysmon' [sysmon is a microsoft product that monitors the registry and eventlogs and fwds it]'
        etc..

=========================================
Viewing Sourcetypes:
From left menu, check under 'SELECTED FIELDS',if sourcetype shows up <click on it>
if not, Click on 'All Fields' and select 'sourcetype' to add to 'SELECTED FIELDS'

Click on sourcetype
Top 10 Values	Count	%	 
xmlwineventlog	270,597	28.311%	
stream:smb	151,568	15.858%	
suricata	125,584	13.139%	
wineventlog	87,725	9.178%	
WinRegistry	74,720	7.817%	
stream:ip	62,083	6.495%	
fgt_traffic	55,279	5.783%	
stream:tcp	28,291	2.96%	
fgt_utm		25,586	2.677%	
stream:http	23,936	2.504%

Understanding some source types:
XmlWinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational  ====="Sysmon, a windows monitoring tool from microsoft"
stream:smb,stream:ip,stream:tcp,stream:http==============="Splunk Stream, which monitors live network traffic"
suricata=================================================="The Suricata Intrusion Detection System(IDS)"
wineventlog and WinRegistry==============================="Windows OS"
fgt_traffic and fgt_utm==================================="Fortigate firewalls"

Optional:
If we see long Sysmon source type such as "XmlwinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"
we can create a macro 'sysmon' to search events with same source type.

Settings> advanced search > search macros > add new
name:sysmon
Defintion:index=botsv1 sourcetype="XmlWinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"
<save>

If created try searching using this macro in search 
search >
Query: `sysmon`

Looking at some interesting processes (choose sampling 1:10)
Query: shows 4205 events

`sysmon` Image="*powershell.exe" OR Image="*msbuild.exe" OR Image="*psexec.exe" OR Image="*at.exe" OR 
Image="*schtasks.exe" OR Image="*net.exe" OR Image="*vssadmin.exe" OR Image="*utilman.exe" OR Image="*wmic.exe"
OR Image="*mshta.exe" OR Image="*wscript.exe" OR Image="*cscript.exe" OR Image="*cmd.exe" OR Image="*whoami.exe"
OR Image="*mmc.exe" OR Image="*systeminfo.exe" OR Image="*csvde.exe" OR Image="*certutil.exe"
| stats values(CommandLine) by Image

Changing search:
Query: 
`sysmon` Image="*powershell.exe" OR Image="*msbuild.exe" OR Image="*psexec.exe" OR Image="*at.exe" OR 
Image="*schtasks.exe" OR Image="*net.exe" OR Image="*vssadmin.exe" OR Image="*utilman.exe" OR Image="*wmic.exe"
OR Image="*mshta.exe" OR Image="*wscript.exe" OR Image="*cscript.exe" OR Image="*cmd.exe" OR Image="*whoami.exe"
OR Image="*mmc.exe" OR Image="*systeminfo.exe" OR Image="*csvde.exe" OR Image="*certutil.exe"
| stats values(CommandLine) by host

Let's look at certain hosts (endpoints) by looking under matched events.
Investing hosts individually
we1149srv
we8105desk
we9041srv

Query:
`sysmon` host=we8105desk | stats values(CommandLine) by Image _time

Sysmon Event Types:
Event ID 1: Process creation
Event ID 2: A process changed a file creation time
Event ID 3: Network connection
Event ID 4: Sysmon service state changed
Event ID 5: Process terminated
Event ID 6: Driver loaded
Event ID 7: Image loaded
Event ID 8: CreateRemoteThread
Event ID 9: RawAccessRead
Event ID 10: ProcessAccess
Event ID 11: FileCreate
Event ID 12: RegistryEvent (Object create and delete)
Event ID 13: RegistryEvent (Value Set)
Event ID 14: RegistryEvent (Key and Value Rename)
Event ID 15: FileCreateStreamHash
Event ID 17: PipeEvent (Pipe Created)
Event ID 18: PipeEvent (Pipe Connected)
Event ID 19: WmiEvent (WmiEventFilter activity detected)
Event ID 20: WmiEvent (WmiEventConsumer activity detected)
Event ID 21: WmiEvent (WmiEventConsumerToFilter activity detected)
Event ID 255: Error

#Event types in Botsv1 -
Query:
index=botsv1 sourcetype=wineventlog | stats count by event_id EventType

or 

`sysmon` | stats count by EventID, EventDescription

or

`sysmon` | stats count by EventID


Query:
index=botsv1 sourcetype=wineventlog | stats count by EventType

We can then look at event types, and count of events.


===========================================================================================================
Viewing stream:http Events

In the "sourcetype" , in the "Top 10 Values list" , click on 'stream:http'
i.e. 
sourcetype = "stream:http"

--This shows records of http events on network( collected by splunk as splunk does live network monitoring)

This should be added to your search bar now 
Query: index=botsv1 sourcetype="stream:http"

Look at the number of events
23,936 events shown ,if no sampling was selected.
22 events,if sampling 1:1000 was selected.

Looking at results shows events that may contain: bytes, bytes_in, html page, destination ip, etc..
We can also stop formatting by clicking on [-] and show it as raw text...(which can then be used for searching)
