Note** Splunk doesn't store the full packet captures, instead it stores metadata, summarizing the information.(to make it more indexable/small)

Try the query:
index=botsv1 sourcetype="stream:http"

and use 'Timeline' to zoom in:
Out of 232 events shown (with sampling 1:100)
Double click on '126 events' > and narrow down to looking at one single event from time line.

We can change the job settings by Job> edit settings [remember each search is a job]
To look at all jobs > on top > Activity > Jobs
every search that was done is remembered for 10 mins (thus we can change the quota in job>edit settings)

Query:
index=botsv1 sourcetype="stream:http"
shows events > Let's select 'Interesting Field'>action 2 (which shows 2 different type of actions:allowed and blocked)
Look at total of these two type of actions which might not be same as total events shown .
Because: We are looking at unstructured data and that basically shows all events with or without these fields.
It also shows how many different values of fields occur and what is %age of it in total events.

Searching based on this field 'action'

index=botsv1 sourcetype="stream:http" action="*"
index=botsv1 sourcetype="stream:http" action!="*"
index=botsv1 sourcetype="stream:http" NOT action="*"
or being specific
index=botsv1 sourcetype="stream:http" action="allowed"
index=botsv1 sourcetype="stream:http" action!="allowed"

==============
Look at 'INTERESTING FIELDS' > punct (takes punctuation marks of data)
[may be interesting when working on web security tasks as objections/directory traversals use punctuations]
==============
Looking at 'INTERESTING FIELDS' > location ( shows locations and shows 85 different values)
Clicking on location shows only Top values (top 10) or Rare value( rare 10)

Select Top values
Query: index=botsv1 sourcetype="stream:http"| top limit=20 location
change the limit as per requirement
Query: index=botsv1 sourcetype="stream:http"| top limit=85 location
