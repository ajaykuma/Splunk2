Get notified about incoming related notable events

While you are investigating an event, you can get notified about incoming notable events that are related 
to the investigation via the investigation toolbar. The investigation toolbar is available on all ES dashboards.
 Settings enabled for an investigation in one dashboard are carried over to that investigation in other dashboards automatically.

Enable the related notable event livefeed.

Click the bell icon on the investigation toolbar at the bottom-right side of the Incident Review page, 
the Investigation Workbench, or any ES dashboard.

Toggle the switch to enable notification for the livefeed.

Click Close.
------------------
While you are investigating, you will get a visual notification if any related notable events occur. 
The bell icon color will change to orange within five minutes of the occurrence.

Acknowledge the livefeed notification or add notable events to the investigation.

Hover over the orange bell icon on the investigation bar at the bottom-right side of the Incident Review page 
or the Investigation Workbench. This tells you how many notable events are available.

Click the orange bell icon.

The related notable event livefeed window appears, containing events from the last 48 hours.

(Optional) Click + to add a notable event to the investigation.

Click Mark All as Seen to clear the livefeed when you no longer want to see the related events. 
This will also reset the notification, so that these no longer count against the notification number mentioned in step 1.

Click Close.
