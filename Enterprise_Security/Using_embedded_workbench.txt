Example of using the embedded workbench

The embedded workbench provides a simplified drill-down experience, reduces the number of open tabs, 
and makes it easier to determine notable event trends.
Using the source field as an example, consider a value where you want more context about an asset. 

From the Enterprise Security menu bar, perform the following steps:

Go to Incident Review.

From a notable event that contains a Source (src) value:

Click the source field actions menu.

Scroll down to the menu items that start with "workbench" and select one such as Workbench - Authentication (src).

View source analysis related to investigated assets or identities. The data source is the Authentication 
data model. Results include events that contain artifacts in the src, dest, user, user_id, 
user_role, src_user, src_user_id, src_user_role, or vendor_account fields.
