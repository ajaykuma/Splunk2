Suppressing a notable event
Hide notable events from the Incident Review dashboard by suppressing them.

on the posture or auditing dashboards. 


Select a notable event on the Incident Review dashboard.
From the Actions menu, select Suppress Notable Events.
Type a Suppression Name.

(Optional) Provide a reason for the suppression using the Description field.

(Optional) Set a date range. After the time limit ends, the suppression filter expires and stops hiding events.

Review the Selected Fields to validate the fields that you want to suppress notable events from. For example, the src field

(Optional) Click change to modify the notable event fields used for the suppression.
