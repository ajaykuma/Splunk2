Example investigation workflow

You are notified of a security incident that needs investigation through a notable event, an alert action, or 
an email, ticket from the help desk, or a phone call.

Create an investigation in Splunk Enterprise Security.

Add colleagues to the investigation as collaborators.

Open the investigation and start investigating on the workbench.

Add artifacts to the investigation scope, in addition to those added automatically from notable events.

Review the tabs and panels for information relevant to your investigation, such as additional affected assets 
or details about the affected assets that can accelerate your investigation.

7. As you investigate, add helpful or insightful events, actions, and artifacts to the investigation to record 
the steps you took in your investigation. 

         a)  Run searches, adding useful searches to the investigation from your action history with      	
the investigation bar or relevant events using event actions. This makes it easy to 	
replicate your work for future, similar investigations, and to make a comprehensive 	
record of your investigation process.

         b)	Filter dashboards to focus on specific elements, like narrowing down a swim lane
 	search to focus on a specific asset or identity on the asset or identity investigator
 	dashboards. Add insightful filtering actions from your action history to the investigation
 	using the investigation bar.

         c)	Triage and investigate potentially-related notable events. Add relevant notable events
 	to the investigation.

         d)	Add notes to record other investigation steps, such as notes from a phone call, email or 
	chat conversations, links to press coverage or social media posts. Upload files like
 	screenshots or forensic investigation files.
8. Complete the investigation and close the investigation and optionally, close associated notable events.

9. Review the investigation summary and share it with others as needed.
